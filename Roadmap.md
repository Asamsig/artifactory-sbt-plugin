Version 0.2: Initial Deploy to artifactory (WE ARE HERE)
Version 0.3: Deploy Build Info with basic properties

Other Tasks:
Make snapshots work properly
Document use of SBT resolver properties as-is, and drop the hack here for resolution
Advanced Artifactory features like License control etc.
Advanced build dependency graph
build a sub-plugin to integrate with the git plugin to get VCS info
Refactor artifactory settings to use immutable settings keys rather than the current hack described in readme
Test framework
More robust error-exception handling.
